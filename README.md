# Simsphere

Welcome to the model Simsphere, a state-of-the art
Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model for use by the general
scientific community. Simsphere is the product of 30 years of continuous
experience and utilization by Toby Carlson and his students at Penn
State. Simsphere is a one-dimensional model that allows one to simulate
the transfer of heat and moisture between plants, soil and atmosphere
over a 24 hour day.

Extensive information about the model is available at
https://simsphere.ems.psu.edu .

## Fortran implementation

This is an updated version of the original Fortran implementation.  The goals for this update include:

* Fortran 2008 compliant code with free-form source formatting.
* Full Implementation of unit tests.
* Restructuring of code to eliminate COMMON blocks in favor of modules.
* Reduce (or eliminate!) use of GO TO and DATA statements.
* Implement data structures to simplify passing arguments to routines, reduce global variables.
* Aspire to rework subroutines with pure function calls.

## Other implementations

A C implementation also exists.  This is available for download at https://simsphere.ems.psu.edu.  The C implementation dates to the late 1990s.

## Building the code

You will need a Fortran 2008 compiler and CMake.  The code is currently being
developed using gfortran 7.3.0.  Please see the [Getting Started
guide](GETTINGSTARTED.md) for additional instructions.

### Unix:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
scripts/build-json-fortran.sh
cmake -H. -B../simsphere-build
cmake --build ../simsphere-build
(cd ../simsphere-build && bin/config && ctest)
```

### Windows:

#### Tooling:
1. Install msys64 from https://www.msys2.org to install gfortran and make:
```
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran mingw-w64-x86_64-make
```
2. Install CMake from https://cmake.org.
3. Add compiler and cmake to the Path environment variable:
```
set %Path%=%Path%;C:\Program Files\CMake\bin;C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
```
4. Install Git from https://git-scm.org.

#### json-fortran dependency
1. Clone https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran (assuming cloned to C:\temp\json-fortran)
2. Build json-fortran in C:\temp\json-build
```
cd c:\temp\json-fortran
cmake -H. -B..\json-build -G "MinGW Makefiles"
cmake --build ..\json-build
```

#### Simsphere
1. Clone https://github.com/tjc181/simsphere and submodules.
2. Configure and build the project with CMake (assuming cloned to C:\temp\simsphere):
```
cd c:\temp\simsphere
cmake -H. -B..\sim-build -G "MinGW Makefiles" 
cmake --build ..\sim-build
cd ..\sim-build
copy ..\json-build\libjsonfortran.dll .
bin\config
ctest
```
